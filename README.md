# eslint-plugin-mmkal

My eslint plugin with rules I find good. If you aren't me you probably shouldn't use this.

## Goals

1. Cover as many js/ts development use-cases as possible
1. Be prescriptive about arbitrary rules like formatting
1. Enforce some degree of consistency
1. Be opinionated but trusting
1. Protect against common gotchas
1. Provide pits of success

### Included

The following plugins/libraries are usable and should "just work" without needing to add extra configs. They should also "just work" if you _have_ defined extra configs like `.prettierrc.js` or `tsconfig.json`.

1. Prettier
1. typescript-eslint
1. eslint-plugin-unicorn

## Non-goals

1. Small package size
