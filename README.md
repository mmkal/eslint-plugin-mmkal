# eslint-plugin-mmkal

My eslint plugin with rules I find good. If you aren't me you probably shouldn't use this.

## Goals

1. Cover as many js/ts development use-cases as possible
1. Be prescriptive about arbitrary rules like formatting
1. Enforce some degree of consistency
1. Be opinionated but trusting
1. Protect against common gotchas
1. Provide pits of success

## Non-goals

1. Small package size
